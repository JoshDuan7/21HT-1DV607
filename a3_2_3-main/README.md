When the program is run you get to see what are the current rules in place and if you follow the instructions then it should not be an issue to run the program.

In order to change the rules you have to go to the App.java class and change the "rulesFactory = new x" while x can be 3 "completed set of rules" which are: PlayerAdvantageRuleFactory(), DefaultGameRuleFactory() and DealerAdvantageRuleFactory().

In order to change the language then in the same class change x in "View v = new x" to the desired language which can be EnglishView() and SwedishView().
